Public static void main,
how I loathe thy name.
Thou art a tedious pain,
driving me insane.

With thy String args[]
thou dost plague my mind,
making me want to flee
and leave this code behind.

But still, I persist
and continue on my way.
For without thee, I cannot exist
in this world of ones and zeroes, I must say.

Public static void main,
though I may hate thee,
I'll always bear thee
and suffer thy company.

For without thee, my code would be lost,
and I would be left in the cold.
So I'll continue to bear thy cost,
and pretend that I love thee, oh so bold.
